# 0x1 Special Thanks

Greatly thank
* [shankerzhiwu and his friend at XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/help/idea-to-root-sonys-e-reader-dpt-rp1-t3654725/post78153143) who made the USB hack possible, and fixed my bricked DPT (not so easy)
* [octavianx](https://github.com/octavianx/Unpack-and-rebuild-the-DPT-RP1-upgrade-firmware) who sheds light on the hack 
* [janten](https://github.com/janten/dpt-rp1-py) who initiates the commandline tool for web APIs
* `silvertriclops` who points out bugs in `get-su-bin` and "forces" me to test it :D
* Thank all who who donated. Thanks for being supportive to all and we are a great community.

# 0x2 What does DPT stand for?

[cough cough] If you don't know what's DPT you won't need this.

# 0x3 Tools Intro

## dpt-tools.py - Automation to gain root, adb, and sudo access

**Heads up!** Use this at your own risk. It has only been fully tested on Macbook Pro.

This is an interative shell commandline tool that wraps processes like updating firmware pkg, obtaining diagnosis access, etc.

## fw_updater_packer_unpacker - Automation to pack/unpack pkg

**Note for developers: Absolutely do NOT `exit 1` while your script (in pkg) has errors.** This will create an infinite loop of "system start -> update via pkg -> shutdown -> restart -> update -> shutdown -> ...". I learned the hard way and there is no way to fix it (soft bricked).

To flash pkg with unverified signature, you need to modify the updater file at `/usr/local/bin/start_eufwupdater.sh`.

Check [this README](https://github.com/HappyZ/dpt-tools/blob/master/fw_updater_packer_unpacker/README.md) for more details.

## systemimg_packer_unpacker

Used to translate the sparse Android image (e.g., system.img) into a mountable ext4 format, and vice versa.

For example:
```
make
./simg2img sparse_image_file_path generated_mountable_file_path
```

# 0x4 Tutorials

Most people would be interested in [the Rooting Guide](https://github.com/HappyZ/dpt-tools/wiki/The-Ultimate-Rooting-Guide). Note that (03/22/2019) I have updated it with a super simple two-step process. But as usual: **read carefully before proceed**!

Also, **do NOT press RESET button if anything goes wrong unless you know what is it actually doing, be patient**. 

After rooting, if interested, please do [the suggested launcher mod](https://github.com/HappyZ/dpt-tools/wiki/Suggested-Launcher-Mod). 

Details in [wiki](https://github.com/HappyZ/dpt-tools/wiki). I have also made flashable PKGs so you do not need to go through nasty steps any more.

# 0x5 About Framework Layout

To achieve a perfect framework layout, it requires you to modify `framework-res.apk` which is too much work to me. I have committed a few modifications for fun at [this place](https://github.com/HappyZ/dpt-framework-res). If you find taobao PKG has a working framework, feel free to drop a message and we can test it. Otherwise, I do not plan to continue on this path. 

Note that you can still use `adb shell wm density 200` to change the density (default is 160, the larger the number, the larger the icon. For per app control, it is possible through the xposed framework and a script. I do hope to find a better solution. Need some insights though.

# 0xF Mission Impossible

Well, to bypass pkg validation, you can also try to decrypt the RSA key and generate corresponding private key, when we actually have enough computation resources and time to do it lol:
