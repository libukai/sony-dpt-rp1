# 0x0 Welcome

We likely have some fun stuff here!

# 0x1 Special Thanks

Great thanks to anonymous contributors all over the Internet even though you guys might not know you helped.

# 0x2 What does DPT stand for?

I will keep this as a secret for now.

But if you read my code and realize what it is about, ping me at yz at 9pm.me and we may work on this together. Or, you can donate a cup of coffee to encourage this work.

# 0x3 Tools

Not ready yet. Still exploring.

## Checklist on Potential Ways

- [ ] Web interface hack
- [ ] USB interface hack
- [ ] ~~Build update package and flash~~ (fails as we cannot bypass pkg validation)
- [ ] ~~Web interface testmode~~ (fails as we do not have `auth nonce` and required private key `K_PRIV_DT`)
- [ ] ~~Official app~~ (fails as the firmware updates purely rely on web interface API)

# 0x4 References

Not gonna reveal those details but let's say there is a place named Google, and there is another place named GitHub.
